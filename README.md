# 🧴 Rust-Oleum SDS & MSDS Documentation

Welcome to the **Rust-Oleum Safety Data Sheets (SDS) & Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) Documentation Project**! 🎉

This repository was created to **collect, organize, and share safety information** for Rust-Oleum products. Whether you’re a **student, business owner, homeowner, or AI researcher**, this project exists to help you:

- 🧑‍🎓 **Learn & Train** – build knowledge around product safety, hazard communication, and chemical awareness.
- 🏠 **Stay Safe at Home** – ensure your family is protected while using or storing Rust-Oleum products.
- 🏢 **Improve Workplace Compliance** – provide employees and businesses with quick access to official documentation.
- 🤖 **Advance AI Research** – supply structured safety documents for machine learning and natural language processing.

## 📖 What Are SDS and MSDS?

### 🔹 SDS (Safety Data Sheet)

An **SDS** is a standardized document required by OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) and other regulatory bodies worldwide. It provides essential information on:

- Hazard identification ⚠️
- Safe handling practices 🧤
- First-aid measures 🚑
- Fire-fighting procedures 🔥
- Accidental release measures 🧯
- Storage and disposal guidelines 🗑️
- Exposure controls & PPE recommendations 🥽

### 🔹 MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheet)

The **MSDS** is the older version of safety documentation. While still used in many places, it has been replaced by the SDS format under the **Globally Harmonized System (GHS)**. Both documents serve the same goal: **protecting people and the environment.** 🌍

This repository contains **both SDS and MSDS** to ensure historical continuity and educational value.

## 🚀 Why This Repository Matters

Rust-Oleum products are **widely used** in:

- 🏡 **DIY projects** (spray paints, coatings, sealers)
- 🏭 **Industrial & commercial settings** (protective coatings, rust preventatives)
- 🎨 **Creative applications** (art, design, and customization)

However, with accessibility comes responsibility. Many of these products:

- Contain **flammable or hazardous chemicals**
- Require **specific handling precautions**
- Must be **stored and disposed of properly**

This repository makes safety data:

- ✅ **Accessible** – free and open to all.
- ✅ **Organized** – searchable, structured, and categorized.
- ✅ **Actionable** – useful for everyday people, professionals, and AI developers.

By centralizing this knowledge, we empower **education, safety, and innovation**.
